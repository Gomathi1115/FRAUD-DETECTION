Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions: Project Summary
üîç Objective:
Developed a fraud detection system using machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. The system leverages anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to flag unusual patterns indicative of fraud.

Key Steps:
Dataset Creation:

Simulated a financial transaction dataset with features such as TransactionAmount and TransactionTime.
Included 2% fraudulent transactions for anomaly detection.
Feature Engineering:

Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure compatibility with detection algorithms.
Algorithms Used:

Isolation Forest: Detects anomalies by isolating observations that deviate significantly from the rest.
Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Identifies anomalies based on local density deviations.
Model Evaluation:

Used Confusion Matrix and Classification Report to assess detection accuracy.
Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were analyzed for both algorithms.
Visualization:

Generated scatter plots to display anomalies detected by Isolation Forest and LOF, providing insights into how the models classified transactions.
Results:
Both models successfully flagged the majority of fraudulent transactions with a low false-positive rate. The comparison of metrics highlighted the relative strengths of Isolation Forest and LOF in detecting anomalies.
